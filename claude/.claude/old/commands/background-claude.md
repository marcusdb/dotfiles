# Background Claude Code

Run a Claude Code instance in the background to perform tasks autonomously while you continue working.

## Variables

USER_PROMPT: $1
MODEL: $2 (defaults to 'sonnet' if not provided)
REPORT_FILE: $3 (defaults to './agents/background/background-report-DAY-NAME_HH_MM_SS.md' if not provided)

## Instructions

- Capture timestamp in a variable FIRST to ensure consistency across file creation and references
- Create the initial report file with header BEFORE launching the background agent
- Fire off a new Claude Code instance using the Bash tool with run_in_background=true
- IMPORTANT: Pass the "USER_PROMPT' exactly as provided with no modifications
- Set the model to either 'sonnet' or 'opus' based on "MODEL ' parameter
- Configure Claude Code with all necessary flags for automated operation
- All report format instructions are embedded in the --append-system-prompt
- Use -print flag to run in non-interactive mode
- Use -output-format text for standard text output
- Use -dangerously-skip-permissions to bypass permission prompts for automated operation
- Use allprovided cli flags AS IS. Do not alter them.
- The append-system-prompt contains all report structure requirements and renaming logic
- IMPORTANT: Do not alter the append-system-prompt in any way.

## Workflow

1. Create the report directory if it doesn't exist:
```bash
mkdir -p agents/background
```
2. Set default values for parameters:
    - `MODEL`
    - `TIMESTAMP` (capture once for consistency)
    - `REPORT_FILE` (using the captured timestamp)

3. Create the initial report file with just the header (IMPORTANT: Only IF no report file is provided - if it is provided, echo it and skip this step):

Get this into your context window so you know what to pass into the Claude Code command.
```bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%a_&H_&M_%S)
echo "TIMESTAMP: ${TIMESTAMP}"
REPORT_FILE="${REPORT_FILE:-./agents/background/background-report-${TIMESTAMP}…md}"
echo "REPORT_FILE: ${REPORT_FILE}"
echo "# Background Agent Report - ${TIMESTAMP]" > "$(REPORT_FILEJ"
```

4. Construct the Claude Code command with all settings:

- Execute the command using Bash with run_in_background=true
```bash claude \
-model "${MODEL}" \
-output-format text \
-dangerously-skip-permissions \
--append-system-prompt "IMPORTANT: You are running as a background agent. Your primary responsibility is to execute work and document your progress continuously in ${REPORT_FILE. Iteratively write to the report file continuously as you work.
Every few tool calls you should update the REPORT_FILE ## Progress section. Follow this file


## Workflow

IMPORTANT: You MUST follow this workflow as you work:

1. The file ${REPORT_FILE) has been created with a header. You must UPDATE as you proceed it (not recreate it) with this EXACT markdown structure:
```markdown
    # Background Agent Report - DAY-NAME_HH_MM_SS

    ## Task-Understanding
    
    Clearly state what the user requested. Break down complex requests into numbered items:
    User requested:
    1. [First task item]
    2. [Second task-item]
    3. [Next task item]

    ## Progress
    
    IMPORTANT: Document each major step as you work. Update this section as you work:
    - Starting task execution
    - [Action taken with tool/command used]
    - [Finding or observation]
    - [Next action]
    (Keep adding bullets as you work)
    
    ## Results

    List concrete outcomes and deliverables with specific details. Update as you work:
    - [Specific file created/modified with path]
    - [Numeric data or metrics]
    - [Actual accomplishments]

    ## Task Completed (or Task Failed)

    [Final summary - sucçess confirmation or failure explanation]

    ADDITIONAL SECTIONS (add as needed):
    - ## Blockers - Issues preventing progress
    - ## Decisions Made - Important choices and
    - ## Recommendations - FollowUp suggestions
